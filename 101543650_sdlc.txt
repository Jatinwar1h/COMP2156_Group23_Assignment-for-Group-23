The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by developers to create high-quality software.
SDLC includes several distinct phases to guide the project from initial concept to final deployment and maintenance.
Documentation Creating and maintaining detailed records of the softwareâ€™s design, code, and usage. 
Project Management Overseeing the entire lifecycle, ensuring timelines, budgets, and resources are properly managed.
The SDLC ensures that software is developed in an efficient and systematic manner.
During the planning phase, project requirements and timelines are defined to ensure clear objectives are set from the start.
It fosters a culture of continuous improvement, where feedback from various stages of the development cycle informs future enhancements.
The SDLC ultimately helps in creating high-quality software, aligning with business goals, and ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.
