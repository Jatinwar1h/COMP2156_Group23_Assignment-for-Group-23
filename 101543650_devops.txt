DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and efficiency in delivering applications and services.
DEVOps focuses on automating and streamlining the processes between software development and IT teams. 
The goal of DevOps is to shorten the development life cycle while maintaining high quality and continuous delivery. 
 By fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, DevOps enables faster and more reliable software releases.
 DevOps also relies heavily on automation, utilizing tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to facilitate code testing, deployment, and scaling.
 The use of monitoring tools in DevOps ensures that systems are running smoothly, and any potential issues can be detected early
 DevOps practices encourage the use of version control systems to track changes, making collaboration between teams more efficient. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is another crucial principle, allowing IT infrastructure to be managed using code, which enhances automation and consistency.
One of the key benefits of DevOps is faster release cycles, which result from the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices
