DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) that promotes collaboration between software development and IT operations teams.
It aims to automate, integrate, and improve the software delivery process for faster and more reliable releases.
DevOps incorporates continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) to streamline code updates.
Key practices in DevOps include infrastructure as code (IaC), automated testing, monitoring, and security integration.
Popular DevOps tools include Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Ansible.
Monitoring and logging help detect and resolve issues proactively, improving system stability.
DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration, breaking down silos between development, operations, and QA teams.
Companies that implement DevOps experience faster time-to-market, lower failure rates, and quicker recovery from failures.
Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide various DevOps services for automation and scalability.
DevOps is continuously evolving, integrating AI, machine learning, and security (DevSecOps) to enhance efficiency and reliability.
