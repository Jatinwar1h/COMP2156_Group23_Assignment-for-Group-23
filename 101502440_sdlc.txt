DevOps SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) integrates DevOps principles into the traditional SDLC.
It consists of phases such as planning, requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
SDLC ensures high-quality software by following a systematic approach with clear objectives at each stage.
During development, programmers write code based on the design specifications.
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) that promotes collaboration between software development and IT operations teams.
After successful testing, the software is deployed to production and made available to users.
The testing phase ensures the software is bug-free, secure, and meets user requirements.
Common SDLC models include Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, V-Model, and DevOps.
