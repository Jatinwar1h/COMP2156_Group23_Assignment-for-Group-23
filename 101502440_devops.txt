DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It aims to automate, integrate, and improve the software delivery process for faster and more reliable releases.
Key practices in DevOps include infrastructure as code (IaC), automated testing, monitoring, and security integration.
DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration, breaking down silos between development, operations, and QA teams.
Popular DevOps tools include Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Ansible.
Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide various DevOps services for automation and scalability.
Companies that implement DevOps experience faster time-to-market, lower failure rates, and quicker recovery from failures.
It enhances agility and efficiency, reducing software development life cycles and improving deployment frequency.
