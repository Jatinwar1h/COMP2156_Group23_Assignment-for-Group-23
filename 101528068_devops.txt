The DevOps SDLC follows an iterative and continuous approach to software development.
It includes phases like planning, development, build, testing, release, deployment, operation, and monitoring.
Agile methodologies and automation are essential to DevOps SDLC.
Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that code changes are frequently merged and tested.
Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release process to minimize manual intervention.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows managing infrastructure through scripts and configuration files.
DevOps SDLC integrates security testing early in the development process (Shift Left approach).
Monitoring and feedback loops help in identifying issues and improving system performance.
Cloud-native technologies and microservices architecture enhance scalability in DevOps SDLC.
The main goal of DevOps SDLC is to deliver reliable, secure, and high-quality software efficiently.
